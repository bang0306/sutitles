00:04 we spend quite a bit of time to talk about how we are going to build this application
00:06 so it's time to actually start write some code
00:12 Let's start by opening our code editor and start up our development server
00:14 I've already opened up my own code editor
00:19 somethind started by running npm run start inside our project directory
00:27 And inside of my code editor, I'm gonna find my index.js file inside the src directory and open it up
00:33 OK, the first thing I wanna do is I wanna play around with React-router
00:40 The end goal I wanna have is just inside this section is to create two different routes the user can visit inside our application
00:47 And based on the route or the URL user is visiting, I wanna see slit different contents appear on the screen
00:55 The first thing we gonna do to make this happen is we are gonna to create two very small components we are just gonna make right now and eventually delete very shortly after
01:02 So inside the index.js file right above the React.render call.
01:06 I'm gonna create these two seperate components we are just using two test process.
01:08 we're gonna make them both class based components.
01:20 so we say class Hello extends React.component, then we define just the render method inside here
01:25 Then we return a div, it contains the text Hello
01:32 Then I duplicate exact the same thing, paste right beneath
01:35 Now I'm gonna change the text inside of this to be Goodbye
01:41 So I change the class name to goodbye and we change the text inside the div to goodbye as well
01:49 Ok, there're two very small test components at this point we've done absolutely nothing specifically to react-router
01:55 So now we are gonna to talking about what we have to write to get react-router started up in our application
02:00 we are starting out by importing a coupou piece of code from react-router
02:05 and we are going to wire each of them up in the ReactDom.render call
02:08 So let's go to the top of the file and get started
02:14 I'm gonna to flipped up to the top of the file and I'm gonna add an import statement
02:20 we're gonna import a couple different items from react-router-dom
02:25 The first thing I'm gonna grab is BrowserRouter
02:34 This Browser Router object right here is inside the react history library and decides what exactly to do based on the change of URL
02:44 The term BrowserRouter in particular is saying I wanna BrowserRouter to look at the entire URL when deciding what different componets show on the screen
02:48 And we definitly talk about some of the different aspects of this later on
02:53 so from right now, we are gonna say this is a piece of code in react history library
03:00 The next thing we are gonna import is the Route Component
03:04 So the Route component here is the real workhorse of all things of react-router
